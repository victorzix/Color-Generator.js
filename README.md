# Color Generator 
This is a color generator that generates color values in hexadecimal

i've used javascript, html and css, but only the basics of it, you can edit the javascript code to get another type of value, like rgb, you just need to remove the ".ToString(16)" from the lines 14, 15, 16 and thats it, the user can copy the generated color values by clicking in the hexcode that was generated.
